    <div>Luca,went on land to hide from his parents who wanted to take him to live with his uncle.
        <br><br>
        He found a new friend who always went on crazy adventures.
        <br><br>
        So they went to a nearby town and entered a competition so they can use the money to buy a vesla.
        <br><br>
        To make a long story short, they won the competition and the land monsters accepted the sea monsters for who
        they were.
